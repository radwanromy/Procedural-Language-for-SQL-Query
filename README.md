PL/SQL offers the concatenation operator (||) for joining two strings. The following table provides the string functions provided by PL/SQL âˆ’

S.No	Function & Purpose
1	
ASCII(x);

Returns the ASCII value of the character x.

2	
CHR(x);

Returns the character with the ASCII value of x.

3	
CONCAT(x, y);

Concatenates the strings x and y and returns the appended string.

4	
INITCAP(x);

Converts the initial letter of each word in x to uppercase and returns that string.

5	
INSTR(x, find_string [, start] [, occurrence]);

Searches for find_string in x and returns the position at which it occurs.

6	
INSTRB(x);

Returns the location of a string within another string, but returns the value in bytes.

7	
LENGTH(x);

Returns the number of characters in x.

8	
LENGTHB(x);

Returns the length of a character string in bytes for single byte character set.

9	
LOWER(x);

Converts the letters in x to lowercase and returns that string.

10	
LPAD(x, width [, pad_string]) ;

Pads x with spaces to the left, to bring the total length of the string up to width characters.

11	
LTRIM(x [, trim_string]);

Trims characters from the left of x.

12	
NANVL(x, value);

Returns value if x matches the NaN special value (not a number), otherwise x is returned.

13	
NLS_INITCAP(x);

Same as the INITCAP function except that it can use a different sort method as specified by NLSSORT.

14	
NLS_LOWER(x) ;

Same as the LOWER function except that it can use a different sort method as specified by NLSSORT.

15	
NLS_UPPER(x);

Same as the UPPER function except that it can use a different sort method as specified by NLSSORT.

16	
NLSSORT(x);

Changes the method of sorting the characters. Must be specified before any NLS function; otherwise, the default sort will be used.

17	
NVL(x, value);

Returns value if x is null; otherwise, x is returned.

18	
NVL2(x, value1, value2);

Returns value1 if x is not null; if x is null, value2 is returned.

19	
REPLACE(x, search_string, replace_string);

Searches x for search_string and replaces it with replace_string.

20	
RPAD(x, width [, pad_string]);

Pads x to the right.

21	
RTRIM(x [, trim_string]);

Trims x from the right.

22	
SOUNDEX(x) ;

Returns a string containing the phonetic representation of x.

23	
SUBSTR(x, start [, length]);

Returns a substring of x that begins at the position specified by start. An optional length for the substring may be supplied.

24	
SUBSTRB(x);

Same as SUBSTR except that the parameters are expressed in bytes instead of characters for the single-byte character systems.

25	
TRIM([trim_char FROM) x);

Trims characters from the left and right of x.

26	
UPPER(x);

Converts the letters in x to uppercase and returns that string.
